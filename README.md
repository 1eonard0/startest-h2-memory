### Summary
It's just a PoC application to be able of apply all the configuration I need to apply "Test of components" using a H2 DB.

This application simulate a service to manage users in a Postgresql DB.

NOTE: it has all CRUD basic operation and in fact this is a functional API.

Then, the main focus is over the configuration of the H2 DB in memory and in the test class.
